To implement GraphQL in your .NET Core project using TypeScript, follow these organized steps:
1. **Set Up Wire :**
   - Create a new module for your API server.
2. **Define API Endpoints with OpenAPI:**
   - Update your `SetupTypeScript` to include necessary TypeScript configurations.
   - Create an OpenAPI specification file, e.g., `doc/OPENAPI.yaml`, detailing your API's endpoints and schemas.
3. **Implement Wire Configuration:**
   - Set up Wire configuration to allow dynamic query operations.
4. **Generate OpenAPI Documentation:**
   - Use tools like Swagger UI or OpenAPI generator to create YAML files that describe your API's endpoints and schemas.
5. **Build and Test Your Application:**
   - Use `dotnet build` with the necessary configurations.
   - Test using tools like Postman to send GraphQL queries and verify responses against your documentation.
6. **Error Handling and Validation:**
   - Ensure proper validation of incoming requests.
   - Implement custom query operations as needed, validating inputs to return appropriate status codes.
7. **Review and Debug:**
   - Check for type errors in Wire configurations.
   - Ensure that GraphQL schemas are correctly defined.
   - Use testing frameworks or tools like Postman to verify functionality.
By following these steps, you'll set up a functional GraphQL API using TypeScript within your .NET Core project, complete with proper documentation and error handling.
