The error you're encountering is related to a missing NuGet package for `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` under version "4.*". This indicates that your `.NET Core` application's configuration  might be referencing an outdated or incompatible NuGet package.
Here's how you can resolve this issue:
1. **Update the .NET Core Configuration:**
   Ensure your appsettings.json includes all necessary NuGet packages with appropriate version constraints.
2. **Update SQL Server Version:**
   Ensure that the SQL Server version specified in appsettings.json is compatible with your .NET Core SDK.
   - For `.NET Core 3.0+` and `.NET Core 7.0`, SQL Server must be at least version 16.0.
   - Update appsettings.json accordingly:
3. **Rebuild the Solution:**
   After making these changes, rebuild your project to ensure all NuGet packages are correctly scoped and available.
By following these steps, you should resolve the NuGet package error and successfully build your .NET Core application with .NET 7.0.
